Anteconomics: 

Definition: A different perspective in the unanticipated allocation of scarce resources, 
the measure of efficiency by measuring a tasks inefficiency.

Anteconomics is a perspective that allows you to measure the efficiency of a task by defining 
their inefficiency instead of their efficiency which as we know is a journey of trial and error.

Lets build X, this is a project based on cost efficiency & inefficiency. 

Pretend we need to build a box called X with four sides and a bottom no top.
Our resources are infinite but our cost are 1X per side which means 5 sides is 5x,
Now say that you have only have 3 employees & every employee can manage 2 sides. 

1E(2sides)+1E(2sides)+1E(2sides)= 
3E(6sides)= 
1Box +1Side

Multiplying by 5 for more iterations

5Boxes+5Side=6Boxes

Now lets say you hire a manager that inspires your employees from 2sides to 3sides. 

1E(3sides)+1E(3sides)+1E(3sides)=      
M=3xEmployee=9Sides =
9X=
M=1Boxes+4Sides
M=1Boxes+4Side  

Multiplying by 5 for more iterations

5Boxes+20Sides=9Boxes

Now we can calculate the efficiency with a manager or without one
By the production of boxes over 5 iterations.

9Boxes-6Boxes= 3Boxes 

So after 5 iterations it is shown that the use of a manager is more efficient or less efficient, 
More efficient would be my suggestion since productivity increased.

Here we used the idea that we can build a box successfully without a manager
and how efficient it would be to build with a manager. 
6/9=0.66 =66% increase in productivity & efficiency. 
Even though efficiency can only be measured in relationship to productivity 
we continue to say that 100-66=33% are still inefficient since we made no changes beyond the 66%.
