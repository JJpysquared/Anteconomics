Definition: The misallocation of scarce resources, this can be intentional 
such as fraud or unintentional such as hiring the wrong worker

For this section I will be working on the unintentional misallocation of scarce resources 
most commonly known as inefficiency by illustrating an excercise called building X.  

Lets build X, this is a project based on productivity. 

Pretend we need to build a box called X with four sides and a bottom no top.
Our resources are infinite but our cost are 1X per side which means 5 sides is 5x,
Now say that you have only have 3 employees & every employee can manage 2 sides. 

1E(2sides)+1E(2sides)+1E(2sides)= 
3E(6sides)= 
1Box +1Side

Multiplying by 5 for more iterations

5Boxes+5Side=6Boxes

Multiplying by 10 for more iterations
10Boxes+10Side=12Boxes


Now lets say you hire a manager that inspires your employees from 2sides to 3sides. 

1E(3sides)+1E(3sides)+1E(3sides)=      
M=3xEmployee=9Sides =
M=1Boxes+4Sides

Multiplying by 5 for more iterations

5Boxes+20Sides=9Boxes

Multiplying by 10 for more iterations
10Boxes+40Sides=18Boxes
-------------------------------------

9Boxes-6Boxes= 3Boxes 
"""

def fx(Iterations):
    Sides=1
    Employee=2*Sides
    MEmployee=3*Sides
   
    MEMP=[]
    EMP=[]
    
    for x in range(0,Iterations):
        
        MEMP.append(x*MEmployee)
        EMP.append(x*Employee)
        
    #print("Employee With Manager:", MEMP)
    #print("Employee Without Manager:", EMP)
    
    return MEMP,EMP

    var=0
    z=[]
    boxes=[]
    sides=[]
    for i in y:
        z.append(x[var]-i)
        var+=1

    return z

iters=17
x,y=fx(iters)
z=z_fx(x,y)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

"""
As you can see on the 15th iteration we have 
30 with out a Manager and 45 with a Manager a difference of 15.
Dividing these values and converting to percentage 45/30=1.5 -1=0.5*100=50%
we get a total of 50% increase in productivity efficiency using a manager.
